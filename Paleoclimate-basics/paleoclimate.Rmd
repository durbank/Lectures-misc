## Overview

- Introduction to paleoclimatology
    - Brief overview of history of Earth's climate
- Introduction to temperature proxy records
- Glaciology-specific temperature proxy records
    - Glacial geomorphology
    - Ice core reconstructions

## Paleoclimatology

- Study of the climate (temperature, moisture, wind vectors, etc.) prior to direct, quantitative observations of climatological variables

- Why would we want to know about climate in the past?

## Paleoclimate

- What's the difference between climatology and paleoclimatology
- How do we measure temperature?

## Paleoclimate

- How do we measure temperature?
    - Mercury displacement (traditional thermometers)
    - Changes in electrical properties (digital thermometers)
    - Emission spectrum (satellites, infrared sensors)

## Paleoclimate

- Direct temperature measurements only go back a few hundred years
- How can we estimate temperature before thermometers?

## Paleoclimate proxies

- An indirect measurement of a variable (i.e. the proxy) that is correlated with some other variable of interest (e.g. temperature)

- Percentage of people wearing a coat

## Paleoclimate proxies

- Examples of temperature proxies:
    - Coral distributions
    - Tree ring widths
    - Types and fequency of vegetation/pollen
    - Fossil assemblages
    - Marine sediment records
    - Geologic units and transitions

## Glacial geomorphology

## Review of glacier mass balance

![](Figures/glacier_mass_balance_456.png)

----

$$\dot{b} = accumulation - ablation$$

- What happens if temperatures increase?
- What happens if more snow falls?

----

$\dot{b} = accumulation - ablation$

![](Figures/glacier_mass_balance_456.png)

## Glacial geomorphology

- Changes in landscape due to presence of or changes in nearby glaciers
    - Glacier valleys
    - Moraines
    - Meltwater planes
    - Glacial scouring
    - Glacial erratics

----

Example of glacial scour

![](Figures/scour.jpg)

## Moraines

- Mass of rock and debris pushed by movement of glacier (best preserved in equilibrium)
- Records the extent of a glacier at a specific point in time
- Three types of moraines:
    - Lateral
    - Medial
    - Terminal

----

![](Figures/moraine_types.png)

## Moraines

- We can use moraine positions to reconstruct glacier growth/retreat over time
- We can then make inferences about the changes in climate driving those glacial changes

----

![](Figures/moraine_map.png)

----

- Glacial geomorphology used to determine relative age/magnitudes of the glacial advances
- Our earliest understanding of ice ages came largely from studies of glacial geomorphology

Timeline of ice ages

| Glaciation stadial | Time |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Last Glacial Period (Wisconsinan Stage) |~115 ka to 11.7 ka |
| Penultimate Glacial Period (Illinoian Stage) | ~194 ka to ~135 ka |

- Any ideas on how they got those names?
  - Locations of major moraine sets used to determine the ice age!

## Complications

- Different glaciers respond to climate differently
- Features can erode naturallly, or overridden by later glacial events
- Difficult to seperate effects of different climatic variables (e.g. temperature or preciptation?)
- Can be difficult to place a specific moraine set to an absolute point in time

----

## Ice cores

## Ice cores

## Stable water isotopes

- Focus specifically on two isotope species
    - Deuterium ($^2H$) and oxygen-18 ($^{18}O$)

- Stable isotopes (i.e. they do not decay over time)

- Naturally occurring, but in much lower abundance

- Isotopes behave chemically similar to more abundant variety
    - Forms water molecules (e.g. $H_2^{18}O$ and $^1H^2H^{18}O$)

## Isotope review

- Same element with differing number of neutrons in the nucleus

----

## Fractionation physics

- Although chemically similar, isotopes respond slightly differently due to differences in bond strength and diffusion velocity

- Heavier isotopes (e.g. $^2H$ and $^{18}O$) vibrate at a lower frequency and diffuse more slowly (conservation of momentum)
    - Energetically more favorable in lower energy states

- This leads to a fractionation effect i.e. a preference of heavier isotopes go into/remain in lower energy phases
    - Isotopic ratio changes during a phase change

----

----

![Stable water isotope abundances](Figures/Abundances.png)

----

- Measure isotopic values as a ratio between the rare isotope and the more common form
    - E.g. $^{18}R = \frac{[H_2^{18}O]} {[H_2^{16}O]}$

- More informative when we express these ratios relative to a standard (V-SMOW)
    - $\delta^{18}O = \frac{^{18}R_{sample} - ^{18}R_{std}} {^{18}R_{std}} x 1000$

----

- Evaporation leads to a water vapor depleted in heavier isotopes, and remnant liquid water enriched

![Fractionation and transport](Figures/isotope_fractionation.jpg)

## Equilibrium fractionation

- Equilibrium and kinetic fractionation influence final $\delta$ values

- In regards to precipitation cycles, most of the isotopic fractionation is governed by equilibrium effects

- Vapor transport gives sufficient time for liquid/vapor constituents to remain in equilibrium

- The amount of equilibrium fractionation is governed by a reaction constant (the 'fractionation factor' $\alpha$)

$$\alpha^{18}O_{water-vapor} = \frac{(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{water}} {(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{vapor}}$$

----

- At lower temperatures, this fractionation constant is highly temperature-dependent

$$10^3 \cdot ln(\alpha^a_b) = \frac {A \cdot 10^6} {T^2} + B$$

- (A and B are constants unique to the substances in exchange)

$$10^3 ln(\alpha^a_b) \approx \delta_a - \delta_b = \Delta^a_b$$

----

- Dansgaard determined an empirical estimate of temperature from $\delta^{18}O$ values:
$$\delta^{18}O \approx 0.62 \cdot T - 15.25$$

- Can be subject to localized variation as well

## Advantages of ice core reconstructions

- Very high resolution (annually resolved for 10s of 100s of thousands of years)
- Highly correlated with temperature (very good proxy)
- Many other records can be extracted as well
    - Dust content
    - Aerosals
    - Atmospheric composition

## Complications

- Mostly limited to polar regions
- Complications in flowing ice
- Limited to ~1 Ma or later
- Other chemical interactions can affect isotope values
- Subject to high frequency variability (not always regionally representative)
